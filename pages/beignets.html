        <h2>Tiana's New Orleans Beignets from The Princess and The Frog</h2>
        <p>Beignets are soft, dough treats that are often coated with powdered sugar.</p>
        <p>However, a honey-coated version of the snack plays a huge part in "The Princess and the Frog."</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3½ Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1½ Teaspoon Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>1¼ Cups Ultra-Pasteurized Milk, Warmed to 110°F</li>
            <li>⅓ Cup Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Fine Sea Salt</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg, room temp</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter, melted</li>
            <li>Cotton Seed or Peanut oil for frying</li>
            <li>Honey for drizzling</li>
            <li>Powdered Sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add warm Milk to your mixing bowl with the paddle attached. Sprinkle in 1½ Teaspoon of Active Dry Yeast, stir and let it sit for a few minutes. When it starts to bubble add ⅓ Cup Granulated Sugar, 1½ Cups All Purpose Flour mix on medium with the paddle attachment until it looks like a smooth batter. Add 1 Large Egg, 2 Tablespoons melted Unsalted Butter, ½ Teaspoon Fine Sea Salt and 2 Cups of All-Purpose Flour. Mix on low until the dough starts to come together, switch to the dough hook and mix on #2 Speed for about 5 Minutes, then turn up to #4 Speed for about 2 Minutes. The dough should be soft and elastic</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, form the dough into a ball and place it into the bowl – cover with plastic and let it rise for about 2 hours in a warm location – an oven with the light on works well

                *INSTANT POT: If you have an Instant Pot, lightly oil the liner, place the dough in the pot and seal the lid. Press the Yogurt button, choose the LESS setting and set for 60 Minutes.</li>
            <li>Dust your counter generously with flour, punch down the dough, dust the top of the dough lightly. Choose your preferred method below.

                Hollow and Crispy: Pre-heat 2 inches of frying oil to 360°F (use a deep fry thermometer to monitor the temperature). Roll out dough to about ⅓ inch thick. Cut into 2-3 inch squares and fry immediately in batches, flip the beignets several times so they brown evenly – don’t over crowd the pot and wait until the temp returns to 360°F before frying the next batch. Drain the beignets on a rack for a minute.
                
                Fluffy and Pillowy: Roll out to ½ inch thick. Cut into 2-3 inch squares. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for 15 minutes. Heat 2 inches of frying Oil to 350°F (use a deep fry thermometer to monitor the temperature). Fry in batches, flip the beignets several times so they brown evenly – don’t over crowd the pot and wait until the temp returns to 350°F before frying the next batch. Drain the beignets on a rack for a minute.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the warm beignets with honey and dust a generous amount of powdered sugar – VERY generous!  There should be a small mountain peak of powdered sugar on each beignet! Enjoy warm with a café au lait!</li>
