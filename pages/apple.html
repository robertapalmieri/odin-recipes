        <h2>The Poison Apple from "Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs"</h2>
        <p>One bite and all yours dreams will come true!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Caramel</li>
            <li>212g brown sugar</li>
            <li>57g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>140g corn syrup</li>
            <li>198g condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3-4 medium granny smith apples</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, salt, and condensed milk over medium high heat. Bring the sugar to 250F.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare each apple by cleaning and drying them thoroughly. Insert a candy or lollipop stick in the center of each apple. Prepare a sheet pan line with parchment.</li>
            <li>When the caramel teaches 250F, turn off the heat. Carefully dip each apple into the hot caramel. Let the excess drip off and place it onto the parchment. Let cool until set.</li>
            <li>Melted the candy melts in the microwave or over a double boiler. IF the candy melts are not smooth, add a bit of vegetable oil until smooth</li>
            <li>Place the candy melted into a squeeze bottle and create the outline of the eyes and nose. Start drizzling the glaze from the top of the apple. Let it drip down like it's shown in the movie. Let it cool in room temperature or in the refrigerator until set.</li>
        </ol>
